# Monte_Carlo_Simulation
Implementation of Monte Carlo Simulation 

A Monte Carlo simulation involves repeated attempts to predict future outcomes. After running the simulation, a distribution of results is generated through thousands or even millions of random trials. This distribution can then be analyzed, and it typically converges to a bell-curve or normal distribution. This aligns with the idea that all natural random events tend to follow a normal distribution given infinite trials.
